# Initialized-Code-Refractor
Applying html css skills

Greetings! Thank you for taking the time to come and check out my first Code Refractory.

In this project, most of the code was already working except for one of the navigation links.  However, there was alot of redundency within the CSS code, which were condensed for a easier visibility.  Most of the elements in the code were non-semantic.  These were changed to semantic elements to give meaning to the way in which they were categorized.  The navigation link was corrected to allow the first item in nav to correctly navigate to the correct element.  

I hope that you'll find the new improved code to your satisfaction.  I toiled away day and night to get the code cleaned spic and span for you!
Take a look around, kick back your feet and enjoy your stay.

Thank you to the wonderful team at UCSD bootcamp Mon and Wed at 6:30pm and Sat 10:00am for making this all possible.
