Applying html css skills

Greetings! Thank you for taking the time to come and check out my first Code Regractory.

I hope that you'll find the new improved code to your satisfaction.  I toiled away day and night to get the code cleaned spic and span for you!
Take a look around, kick back your feet and enjoy your stay.

Thank you to the wonderful team at UCSD bootcamp Mon and Wed at 6:30pm and Sat 10:00am for making this all possible.
